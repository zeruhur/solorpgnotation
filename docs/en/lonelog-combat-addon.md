# Combat Add-on

## Overview

Combat is where solo play gets dense. Dice fly, hit points drop, positions shift—and you're running both sides. Without structure, your log turns into a wall of text where you can't tell who hit whom or when things went wrong.

This add-on gives you optional notation for tactical encounters. It layers on top of core Lonelog—using the same `@`, `d:`, `->`, `=>` symbols—and adds just enough structure to keep fights readable without turning your session into a spreadsheet.

Not every solo game has tactical combat. *Thousand Year Old Vampire* doesn't need round tracking. A *Mythic GME*-driven investigation might resolve a bar fight in a single oracle question. If your system resolves combat with a single roll, core notation handles it fine:

```
@ Fight the bandits
d: Combat 2d6=9 -> Strong Hit
=> I cut through them and escape into the alley.
```

This add-on is for everything more involved than that—games where you're tracking rounds, multiple combatants, ranges, and changing hit points.

---

### What This Add-on Adds

| Addition | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `[F:Name\|stats]` | Track combatant stats and status | `[F:Thug\|HP 6\|Close]` |
| `[COMBAT]` / `[/COMBAT]` | Delimit a tactical encounter within a scene | `[COMBAT] ... [/COMBAT]` |
| `Rd#` round markers | Separate initiative rounds within a combat block | `Rd1`, `Rd2`, `Rd3` |
| `@(Name) Action` | Attribute actions to non-PC actors | `@(Thug A) Lunges at me` |
| `Rd# Roster: [tags]` | Snapshot all combatant states at a round boundary | `Rd3 Roster: [PC:HP 3] [F:Boss\|HP 4]` |

**No new core symbols.** This add-on introduces no additions to `@`, `?`, `d:`, `->`, or `=>`.

---

### Design Principles

**No new core symbols.** Combat uses `@`, `d:`, `->`, `=>` exactly as defined in core Lonelog. New elements are structural markers and formatting conventions only—not symbolic shortcuts.

**Scale to complexity.** A quick skirmish needs less notation than a five-round battle with six combatants. Use only as much structure as the encounter demands. The add-on supports both extremes.

**Actor clarity first.** The central problem of combat logging is knowing who is doing what. Every addition here serves that goal—round markers separate turns, the `@(Name)` prefix identifies non-PC actors, foe tags track changing states.

---

## 1. Combat Blocks

Some encounters benefit from a structural boundary that signals a change in mode—denser notation, round-by-round tracking, mechanical state changes. The `[COMBAT]` block provides that boundary.

**Format:**

```
[COMBAT]
...combat notation...
[/COMBAT]
```

#### 1.1 In Scene Headers

When the entire scene is a fight, place `[COMBAT]` in the scene header:

```
S5 *Warehouse ambush* [COMBAT]
```

No closing tag is needed—the next scene marker ends the encounter.

#### 1.2 Inline During a Scene

When combat starts mid-scene, open and close the block around the tactical section:

```
S5 *Warehouse, midnight*
@ Search the crates for evidence
d: Investigation d6=5 vs TN 4 -> Success
=> I find shipping manifests—but hear footsteps behind me.

[COMBAT]
...combat notation here...
[/COMBAT]

=> With the thugs unconscious, I grab the manifests and run.
```

The `[COMBAT]` / `[/COMBAT]` delimiters let you visually separate the tactical section from the narrative, find combat encounters when scanning a log, and signal to future-you that denser notation follows.

#### 1.3 Analog Format

For paper notebooks, use dashed separators:

```
--- COMBAT ---
...combat notation...
--- END COMBAT ---
```

Or skip delimiters entirely—the round markers below already signal combat.

**When to skip the block:** If combat resolves in one or two rolls, core notation handles it without any block structure.

---

## 2. Round Tracking

Discrete combat rounds get `Rd#` markers. Think of them as mini-scenes within the fight.

**Format:**

```
Rd1
...actions...

Rd2
...actions...
```

**Numbering:** Start at `Rd1` each combat. Rounds are local to the encounter, not the session.

**Example — minimal:**

```
Rd1 @ Slash d:17≥12 Hit HP-5 @(Thug) d:9≥15 Miss
Rd2 @ Finish him d:20≥12 Hit => [F:Thug|dead]
```

**Example — expanded:**

```
Rd1
@ Draw sword and attack Thug A
d: d20+5=17 vs AC 12 -> Hit
d: 1d8=5 damage
=> [F:Thug A|HP-5|HP 1|staggered]

@(Thug A) Wild swing back
d: d20+3=9 vs AC 15 -> Miss
=> He's off-balance—I press the advantage.

Rd2
@ Strike again
d: d20+5=14 vs AC 12 -> Hit
d: 1d8=6 damage
=> [F:Thug A|dead]
```

**When to skip round markers:** If combat is fast (one or two rolls) or your system doesn't use discrete rounds, log actions sequentially without markers.

---

## 3. Tracking Combatants

Core Lonelog tracks NPCs with `[N:Name|tags]`. In combat, you often need tighter tracking—hit points, position, status effects that change every round. The **foe tag** `[F:Name|stats]` is a combat-specific variant designed for this.

**Format:**

```
[F:Name|key stats|position|status]
```

**Fields:**

- `Name` — combatant identifier; use A/B suffixes to distinguish individuals of the same type
- `key stats` — mechanical values: `HP 6`, `AC 12`, `ATK +3`
- `position` — range or zone: `Close`, `Medium`, `Far`, `Engaged`, `Zone:Alley`
- `status` — conditions: `wounded`, `staggered`, `dead`, `fled`

#### 3.1 Individual Foes

```
[F:Thug A|HP 6|Close|armed]
[F:Cultist Leader|HP 12|Far|spellcaster]
```

Update foe tags as stats change—either on a new line or inline:

```
[F:Thug A|HP 6|Close]
...Thug A takes 3 damage...
[F:Thug A|HP 3|Close|wounded]

...or shorthand:
[F:Thug A|HP-3]
```

#### 3.2 Grouped Foes

When individuals don't need separate tracking, group them:

```
[F:Goblins×4|HP 3 each|Close]
...one dies...
[F:Goblins×3|Close]
```

Split groups when they diverge in position or status:

```
[F:Pirate 1|Close|wounded]
[F:Pirate 2|Medium|crossbow]
```

#### 3.3 Position and Movement

Track range as a tag attribute. Common range bands:

```
[F:Archer|HP 5|Far]
[F:Thug|HP 6|Close]
[F:Wolf|HP 4|Engaged]     (in melee)
```

Show movement with an arrow notation:

```
@(Thug A) Rushes in [Far->Close]
[F:Thug A|Close]
```

For grid or zone-based systems:

```
[F:Thug A|HP 6|Zone:Alley]
[F:Thug B|HP 4|Zone:Rooftop]
[PC:Alex|Zone:Street]
```

**Why `[F:]` instead of `[N:]`?** `[N:]` is for persistent NPCs who matter to your story. `[F:]` is for combatants—often disposable, defined by mechanical stats rather than narrative tags. The distinction keeps your NPC index clean. A recurring villain might be `[N:Viktor|ambitious|ruthless]` in narrative scenes and gain a `[F:Viktor|HP 15|Far|armored]` when the swords come out.

**When to skip foe tags:** For simple fights (one enemy, no position tracking), `[N:]` or naming the enemy in prose works fine. Foe tags earn their keep when you need to track multiple combatants with changing stats.

---

## 4. Actor Actions

In normal play, `@` always means "I, the player character, do something." In combat, enemies and allies act too. **`@` stays as the PC action. For other actors, prefix the action with the actor's name in parentheses.**

| Actor | Format | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| PC (default) | `@ Action` | `@ Swing at Thug A` |
| Named foe | `@(Name) Action` | `@(Thug A) Slash at PC` |
| Group | `@(Group) Action` | `@(Goblins) Swarm attack` |
| Ally NPC | `@(Name) Action` | `@(Jordan) Cover fire` |

**Example — minimal:**

```
Rd1
@ Slash d:18≥12 Hit HP-6 => [F:Thug A|dead]
@(Thug B) Stab d:14≥15 Miss
```

**Example — expanded:**

```
Rd1
@ Draw sword and attack Thug A
d: d20+5=18 vs AC 12 -> Hit
d: 1d8=6 damage
=> [F:Thug A|HP-6|dead]

@(Thug B) Lunges at me with a knife
d: d20+3=14 vs AC 15 -> Miss
=> The knife whistles past my ear.
```

**Why not a new symbol for foe actions?** Because `@` already means "action taken." The parenthetical prefix identifies who—that's all the disambiguation needed. Adding a symbol (like `!` or `>>`) would break the Lonelog principle of minimal core symbols and add one more thing to remember mid-fight.

**Reactions and interrupts:** Log them where they happen with a parenthetical note:

```
@(Alex) Riposte (reaction)
@ Opportunity attack (interrupt)
```

**Shorthand for fast combats:** When speed matters more than readability, go chronological within each round and let the foe tags provide context:

```
Rd1
[F:Thug A|Close] @(A) Slash -> d:14≥15 Miss
[PC] @ Riposte -> d:18≥12 Hit => [F:Thug A|HP-6|dead]
[F:Thug B|Close] @(B) Stab -> d:11≥15 Miss
```

**Roll context:** When a combatant's tags or status directly affect the mechanics of a roll, note them inline using roll context (core Lonelog §4.1.9):

```
@(Pirate Captain) Presses the attack
d: d20+6 [against: staggered] = 11 vs AC 14 -> Miss

@ Strike at the weakened Captain
d: d20+5 [+flanking, +high ground] = 18 vs AC 13 -> Hit
```

This is most useful in tag-heavy systems (City of Mist, Fate) where named tags mechanically modify rolls. In traditional d20 systems, the roll line alone is usually sufficient.

---

## 5. Complex Encounters

When more than two sides clash, structure matters most.

#### 5.1 Encounter Setup

Before Rd1, establish the battlefield with a combat snapshot listing all combatants with initial positions and key stats:

```
S9 *Dockside ambush* [COMBAT]
[PC:Alex|HP 12|Engaged]
[N:Jordan|ally|HP 8|Close]
[F:Pirate Captain|HP 10|Close|armed|sword]
[F:Pirate×2|HP 4 each|Medium|armed|crossbow]
[F:Dock Rat|HP 2|Engaged|knife]
```

This is your combat snapshot—the state of the field when initiative starts.

#### 5.2 Round Rosters

For fights with many combatants and fast-changing stats, open each round with a roster line:

```
Rd3 Roster: [PC:Alex|HP 3] [N:Jordan|HP 4] [F:Captain|HP 4] [F:Pirate×1|HP 4]
```

This gives you a snapshot at each round without hunting back through the log.

**Scaling tips:**

- **Group identical foes.** `[F:Pirate×2]` beats tracking Pirate A and Pirate B separately—unless they're in different positions or have different status.
- **Split groups when needed.** If one pirate moves and the other doesn't: `[F:Pirate 1|Close]` `[F:Pirate 2|Medium]`.
- **Kill the tags, keep the story.** Don't track HP for mooks if one hit kills them. Just note `[F:Rat|dead]`.
- **Use rosters** when you have 5+ combatants or stats are changing fast enough that you'd lose track without a summary.

---

## 6. Combat Aftermath

When combat ends, bridge back to the narrative with `=>`, update persistent tags, and open any new threads:

```
[/COMBAT]
=> Two pirates dead, the captain fled into the fog. Jordan is wounded.
[N:Jordan|wounded|HP 4]
[Thread:Pirate Captain's Revenge|Open]
[PC:Alex|HP 5|Stress+1]
```

This reconnects the mechanical combat to your ongoing story.

**Loot and rewards:**

```
=> I search the bodies.
tbl: d100=67 -> "Captain's sea chart"
=> A map showing a hidden cove. [E:PirateCove 1/4]
[PC:Alex|Gear+Sea Chart]
```

---

## 7. Putting It All Together

Here's the same encounter at three levels of detail—find your comfort zone.

#### Ultra-compact

```
S9 *Dock ambush* [COMBAT]
[PC:HP 12] [F:Captain|HP 10] [F:Pirate×2|HP 4] [F:Rat|HP 2]

[N:Jordan|wounded] [PC:Alex|HP 5|Stress+1]
[Thread:Pirate Captain's Revenge|Open]
```

#### Narrative-rich

```
S9 *Dockside, fog rolling in off the harbor*

The crates provide cover, but not for long. A rat-faced man with a
knife lunges from behind a barrel. Behind him, the Pirate Captain
draws his cutlass with a grin. Two crossbowmen take position on the
cargo stack.

[COMBAT]
[PC:Alex|HP 12|Engaged] [N:Jordan|ally|HP 8|Close]
[F:Pirate Captain|HP 10|Close|cutlass]
[F:Pirate×2|HP 4 each|Medium|crossbow]
[F:Dock Rat|HP 2|Engaged|knife]

Rd1
@ Sidestep the Dock Rat and slash
d: d20+4=17 vs AC 10 -> Hit, 1d8=5
=> The rat-faced man crumples. [F:Dock Rat|dead]

But I've left my flank open.

@(Pirate Captain) Charges across the dock, cutlass high [Close->Engaged]
d: d20+6=19 vs AC 14 -> Hit, 1d8+2=7
=> His blade bites deep across my ribs. I stagger back. [PC:Alex|HP 5|wounded]

PC: "Jordan—the crossbows!"

@(Jordan) Snaps off a shot at the Captain
d: d20+3=12 vs AC 13 -> Miss
=> The bolt sparks off a mooring chain.

@(Pirate×2) Fire at Jordan from the cargo stack
d: d20+2=15, d20+2=9 vs AC 11 -> 1 Hit, 1 Miss
d: 1d6=4
=> A bolt punches through Jordan's shoulder. [N:Jordan|HP 4|wounded]

N (Jordan): "I'm hit—still in it!"

Rd2
The Captain is close, bleeding confidence. I press the advantage.

@ Power attack on Captain
d: d20+4=20 vs AC 13 -> Critical Hit, 1d8×2=8
=> My sword catches him across the chest. He stumbles. [F:Captain|HP 2|staggered]

@(Captain) Wild swing in desperation
d: d20+6=11 vs AC 14 -> Miss
=> His cutlass sweeps wide—I duck under it.

@(Jordan) Pivots and fires at the crossbowmen
d: d20+3=16 vs AC 11 -> Hit, 1d6=5
=> One pirate tumbles off the cargo stack. [F:Pirate×1|dead]

The surviving pirate drops his crossbow and bolts into the fog.
[F:Pirate×1|fled]

Rd3
@ Chase the Captain before he escapes
d: Athletics d6=3 vs TN 5 -> Fail
=> He's too fast—vaults the dock railing and drops into a hidden
rowboat. The fog swallows him in seconds.

[/COMBAT]

I press a hand to my ribs, breathing hard. Jordan limps over,
shoulder dark with blood. The dock is quiet except for lapping water
and the creak of ropes.

PC (Alex): "He'll be back."
N (Jordan): "Then we'd better be ready."

=> Two pirates dead, one fled, Captain escaped by sea.
[N:Jordan|wounded|HP 4] [PC:Alex|HP 5|Stress+1]
[Thread:Pirate Captain's Revenge|Open]
```

## Cross-Add-on Interactions

| Situation | Add-on(s) Used | Key Tags/Blocks |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Tracking consumables used during combat | Combat + Resource Tracking | `[F:]`, `[Inv:Name\|#]` |
| Combat in an explored dungeon room | Combat + Dungeon Crawling | `[COMBAT]`, `[R:Room\|state]` |

**Combined example — Combat + Resource Tracking:**

```
S7 *Guard room* [COMBAT]
[PC:Alex|HP 10|Engaged] [Inv:Health Potion|2]
[F:Guard×2|HP 5 each|Close|armed]

Rd1
@ Strike Guard 1
d: d20+4=19 vs AC 12 -> Hit, 1d8=7
=> [F:Guard 1|dead]

@(Guard 2) Counterattack
d: d20+3=16 vs AC 14 -> Hit, 1d6=4
=> [PC:Alex|HP-4|HP 6]

Rd2
@ Drink healing potion (action)
=> [PC:Alex|HP+4|HP 10] [Inv:Health Potion|1]

@(Guard 2) Retreats and raises alarm
=> [F:Guard 2|fled]

[/COMBAT]
=> Guard room clear, one potion used, alarm raised.
[Thread:Alarm Raised|Open]
```

---

## System Adaptations

### D&D 5e / OSR Systems

These systems use AC, d20 attack rolls, and explicit damage dice—the combat add-on maps naturally. Use the `vs AC #` convention in `d:` lines and include damage on the same line or the next.

```
[F:Skeleton|HP 13|AC 13|Close]

Rd1
@ Attack with shortsword
d: d20+4=17 vs AC 13 -> Hit
d: 1d6+2=7 damage
=> [F:Skeleton|HP-7|HP 6|damaged]

@(Skeleton) Claw swipe
d: d20+4=11 vs AC 15 -> Miss
```

### Ironsworn / Starforged

These systems use move-based resolution without traditional initiative. Round markers are optional—each move generates its own outcome. Focus on move names as action labels and use foe tags for tracking enemy harm and threat state.

```
[COMBAT]
[F:Broken|Formidable|Engaged]
[Track:Broken|Progress 0/10]

@ Enter the Fray (facing off)
d: Action=3+Heart=2=5 vs Challenge=6,8 -> Miss
=> Broken strikes first. Pay the Price. Foe has initiative.

@ Face Danger (Attempting to deflect the incoming strike)
d: Action=1+Iron=3=4 vs Challenge=7,8 -> Miss
=> Pay the Price: -3 health. Foe retains initiative.

@ Endure Harm (-3 health)
d: Action=2+Iron=3=5 vs Challenge=4,8 -> Weak Hit
=> Press on.
[PC:Alex|health-3]

@ Clash (foe has initiative, close quarters)
d: Action=4+Iron=3=7 vs Challenge=5,9 -> Miss
=> Momentum=10 > Challenge=5,9; burn to cancel both challenge dice -> Strong Hit
=> +1 Harm. 3 harm (deadly weapon) -> mark 3 progress. I gain the initiative.
[Track:Broken|Progress 3/10]
[PC:Alex|momentum=2]

@ Strike (I have initiative, close quarters)
d: Action=6+Iron=3=9 vs Challenge=2,4 -> Strong Hit
=> +1 harm. 3 harm (deadly weapon) -> mark 3 progress. I retain initiative.
[Track:Broken|Progress 6/10]

@ End the Fight
d: Progress=6 vs Challenge=3,5 -> Strong Hit
=> Broken is no longer in the fight.
[F:Broken|dead]
[/COMBAT]
```

### Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA)

PbtA games rarely use discrete rounds—moves resolve fiction, not turns. Use `[COMBAT]` only for extended conflicts where tracking harm or threat levels adds value. Log moves with their names and results as normal.

```
[COMBAT]
[F:Gang×6|Threat 3|Close]

@ Seize by Force — throw myself into them
d: 2d6+2=9 -> 7–9 Weak Hit
=> I take definite harm: choose one of their tags.
[PC:Alex|harm-1] [F:Gang×6|Threat-1|Threat 2]

[/COMBAT]
```

---

## Best Practices

**Do: Scale notation to encounter complexity**

```
✔ Simple fight:
@ Slash at the guard
d: d20+4=15 vs AC 12 -> Hit, 1d8=5
=> He drops. Clear.

✔ Complex fight:
S5 *Warehouse ambush* [COMBAT]
[F:Captain|HP 10|Close] [F:Guard×2|HP 4 each|Medium]
Rd1
@ Charge at Captain...
```

**Don't: Over-engineer simple encounters**

```
✗ [COMBAT]
  Rd1 Roster: [PC:Alex|HP 10] [F:Guard|HP 4|Close|armed|alert]
  @ Attack Guard
  d: d20+4=15 vs AC 10 -> Hit
  => [F:Guard|HP-6|dead]
  [/COMBAT]

✔ @ Cut down the lone guard before he can shout.
  d: d20+4=15 -> Hit, 6 dmg. Dead.
```

**Do: Use `@(Name)` for all non-PC actors**

```
✔ @(Thug B) Flanks me
  d: d20+3=17 vs AC 15 -> Hit, 1d6=4
  => [PC:Alex|HP-4]

✔ @(Jordan) Returns fire
  d: d20+3=14 vs AC 11 -> Hit
  => [F:Pirate 1|dead]
```

**Don't: Invent new symbols for enemy actions**

```
✗ ! Thug attacks: d20+3=17 -> Hit => PC HP-4
✗ >> Guard lunges: d20+2=12 -> Miss

✔ @(Thug) Attacks
  d: d20+3=17 -> Hit => [PC:Alex|HP-4]
```

**Do: Update foe tags as stats change mid-encounter**

```
✔ [F:Captain|HP 10|Close]
  ...after 7 damage...
  [F:Captain|HP 3|staggered]
```

**Don't: Reconstruct state retroactively**

```
✗ (Five rounds with no intermediate updates)
  => Captain is at HP 3 somehow.

✔ Track changes in-round: [F:Captain|HP-7|HP 3|staggered]
```

**Do: Write aftermath as narrative, not just tags**

```
✔ [/COMBAT]
  => Two pirates dead, one fled, the captain escaped by sea.
  Jordan is wounded but walking. I have questions about that ship.
  [N:Jordan|wounded|HP 4] [Thread:Pirate Captain's Revenge|Open]
```

**Don't: End combat with only tag updates**

```
✗ [/COMBAT]
  [N:Jordan|wounded|HP 4]
  [PC:Alex|HP 5]
```

## FAQ

**Q: When should I use this add-on instead of core notation?**
A: When combat lasts three or more rounds, when multiple combatants act each round, or when turn order and position matter to the story. For single-roll fights, core notation is sufficient.

**Q: Should I track initiative order?**
A: Only if your system uses it and it matters. Most solo players go in logical order (threats first, then PC, then allies) or follow their system's rules. To note it: `Rd1 (Init: Captain 18, Alex 15, Jordan 12, Pirates 8)`.

**Q: Do I need `[F:]` tags, or can I just use `[N:]`?**
A: Either works. `[F:]` is a convenience for separating combat stats from narrative NPC tags—it keeps your NPC index cleaner in long campaigns. For simple fights, `[N:]` is fine.

**Q: What about reactions, interrupts, or out-of-turn actions?**
A: Log them where they happen with a parenthetical note: `@(Alex) Riposte (reaction)` or `@ Opportunity attack (interrupt)`.

**Q: How do I handle area effects or multi-target attacks?**
A: List the targets and roll for each, or roll once and apply to all:

```
@ Fireball targeting Goblin×3
d: 8d6=28, DC 14 Dex save
d: Goblin 1: 12≤14 Fail, Goblin 2: 17≥14 Success, Goblin 3: 8≤14 Fail
=> Two goblins incinerated. One dodged, half damage. [F:Goblin×1|HP 2|singed]

**Q: What about vehicle combat, chase scenes, or mass battles?**
A: This add-on covers personal-scale combat. Those scenarios may warrant their own add-ons—but the principles here (round markers, actor prefixes, position tracking) will apply.

**Q: How does this work in an analog notebook?**
A: Use `--- COMBAT ---` and `--- END COMBAT ---` as delimiters. Round markers (`Rd1`, `Rd2`) work as-is. For foe tags, write them in the margin or in a column beside the round text. Update HP with strikethroughs: ~~HP 6~~ HP 3.

**Q: When should I use round rosters?**
A: When you have five or more combatants and stats are changing fast enough that you'd lose track without a summary. For smaller fights, tracking changes inline with foe tags is sufficient.
